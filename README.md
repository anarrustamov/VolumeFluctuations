# VolumeFluctuations

## A Python package for analytic derivations of formulas for volume fluctuations and their corrections

### The formalism and analytic formulas used in the package are based on the publication:

- ### Volker Koch, Romain Holzmann, Anar Rustamov, Joachim Stroth
  #### arXiv:

#### Controlling volume fluctuations for studies of critical phenomena in nuclear collisions

### *If you use the code to produce results for a publication,* 
### *we ask you to be fair and cite the above paper!*

## Users guide
A fast and efficient way to run the code, is to use the graphical interface,
which is started with the command:
